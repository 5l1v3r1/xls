# XLS: Accelerator Synthesis

# TODO(leary): 2020-06-29 This structure is a work-around to publically expose
# XLS APIs. Once the public XLS API is determined, those packages should be
# explicitly marked with 'xls_public' visibility, and this should be changed so
# that 'xls_public' includes 'xls_internal' and not vice versa.
