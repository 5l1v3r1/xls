  This datatype is "stackable" so that we can easily take the bindings at a
  given point in the program (say in a function) and extend it with a new scope
  by stacking a fresh Bindings object on top (sometimes also referred to as a
  "scope chain"). For example:

    builtin_bindings = Bindings(None)
    builtin_bindings.add('range', ast.BuiltinNameDef('range'))

    # Create a fresh scope, with no need to copy the builtin_bindings object.
    function_bindings = Bindings(builtin_bindings)
    f = parse_function(function_bindings)

  We can do this because bindings are immutable and stack according to lexical
  scope; new bindings in the worst case only shadow previous bindings.
